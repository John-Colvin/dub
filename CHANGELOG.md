     - Added support for copying directories (by Vadim Lopatin) - [pull #471][issue471]
     - Files are now hard linked into the target directory instead of making a real copy
     - Avoids to hard link `"copyFiles"` that have not changed in the source directory on Windows - [issue #511][issue511]
 - DUB now searches the PATH for installed compilers and chooses the default compiler as appropriate - [issue #480][issue480], [pull #506][issue506]
 - `--build-mode=singleFile` can now build several files in parallel using the `--parallel` switch - [issue #498][issue498]

v0.9.22 - 2014-09-22
--------------------

### Features and improvements ###

 - Implemented an improved dependency handling (supported by Matthias Dondorff)
	 - Deprecated `"~branch"` based dependencies - these have proven to facilitate unresolvable versioning conflicts
	 - Added a "selections" file that contains the pinned versions of all dependencies for more control - `dub upgrade` can be used to update this file
	 - Package selections can be overridden user or system wide using `dub add-override`
	 - When determining the version of a GIT working copy, the latest tag is preferred over the branch
	 - See the [full rationale](https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/dub/wiki/...)
 - Implemented the `dub dustmite` command for comfortable creation of reduced test cases of DUB packages
	 - All packages are automatically copied to an isolated folder where [Dustmite](https://github.com/CyberShadow/DustMite/wiki) can do its job
	 - DUB is run in a special mode that doesn't require expensive initialization, so that it doesn't slow down the reduction process
	 - The test condition can be a specific exit code or an output regex match on either the compiler, linker, or program run
 - Added support for single file builds (by Mathias Lang aka Geod24) - [pull #364][issue364]
 - The special `"*"` version specification now matches any version or branch (should always be used for referencing sub packages of the same package)
 - Warn about using certain build options outside of build types (in addition to warning about certain `"dflags"`)
 - Removed explicit linking against Phobos on Linux when building using DUB (fixed building with DMD 2.065)
 - Fixed imports for DMD master (by John Colvin) - [pull #283][issue283]
 - Path based dependencies don't require a version number anymore (ignored)
 - Add support for vibe.d based HTTP downloads for better integration into vibe.d projects
 - `"mainSourceFile"` is now implicitly added to `"sourceFiles"`
 - `"preGenerateCommands"` are now run before collecting source files, enabling better support for generating source files - [issue #144][issue144]
 - Added a `-missing-only` switch to `dub upgrade` to get the same upgrade/fetch behavior as for `dub build` - see also [issue #271][issue271]
 - The default compiler is now the one that was used to build DUB itself (by Iain Buclaw) - [pull #303][issue303]
 - When running an executable, the working directory is now only changed if an explicit `"workingDirectory"` is specified
 - The compiler is now invoked to determine the actual build platform for the chosen compiler flags instead of simply guessing
	 - Implemented for GDC by Kinsey Moore aka opticron - [pull #324][issue324]
 - Added a basic `dub clean` command - [issue #134][issue134]
 - Added a spell checker for the `-c`/`--config` flag (by Andrej Mitrovic) - [pull #313][issue313]
 - Added support for `$ROOT_PACKAGE_DIR` and `$<dependency>_PACKAGE_DIR` variables
 - Generalized the `--local`/`--system` flags to `--cache=<location>`, which is now available for all commands (by Colden Cullen) - [pull #306][issue306]
 - Added a `--build-mode` switch to choose between combined build and separate compile/link for DMD
 - When building a static library, its dependencies are not built anymore - [issue #316][issue316]
 - Displaying the line number where parsing a JSON document fails - see [issue #317][issue317]
 - Added a shorthand syntax for sub packages (":subpack" instead of "parent:subpack") - [issue #315][issue315]
 - Replace all "package.json" files/mentions with "dub.json" and clean up white space throughout the code base (by James Clarke aka jrtc27) - [pull #337][issue337], [pull #338][issue338], [pull #339][issue339]
 - `dub describe` not outputs all source/import files of all configurations and platforms - [issue #185][issue185]
 - Added basic support for the new human readable `"systemDependencies"` field
 - Added a `--temp-build` switch to force building in a temporary folder - [issue #294][issue294]
 - Using `executeShell` when invoking tools to enable more flexible use of shell features - [issue #356][issue356]
 - `dub init` now creates a default `.gitignore` file
 - An exit code of `-9` for a tool now triggers a short message with a possible cause (out of memory)
 - The information about possible package upgrades is now cached for one day, resulting in less online queries to the package registry
 - Implemented separate compile/link mode for GDC (by Mathias Lang aka Geod24) - [pull #367][issue367]
 - `.def` files are now passed to the linking stage when doing separate compile/link building
 - Added BASH shell completion script (by Per Nordlöw) - [issue #154][issue154]
 - Added FISH shell completion script (by Matt Soucy) - [pull #375][issue375]

 - Added `dub test` to run the unit tests of a package using a custom main() function
 - Public sub packages can now (and are recommended to) reside in sub folders
